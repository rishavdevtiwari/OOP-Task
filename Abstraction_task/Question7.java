//7. You are developing a restaurant management system that handles different types of employees, 
//such as chefs and waiters. Design an interface named "Employee" with the following methods:

//work(): This method should define the work responsibilities of the employee.

//(): This method should return the salary of the employee.

interface Employee {
    void work();
    double getSalary();
}

class Chef implements Employee {
    private double salary;
    
    public Chef(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Chef is preparing delicious meals.");
    }
    
    @Override
    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}

class Waiter implements Employee {
    private double salary;

        this.salary = salary;

    }
    
    @Override
